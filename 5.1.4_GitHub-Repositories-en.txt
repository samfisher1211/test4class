Welcome to GitHub Repositories!
After watching this video, you will be able to:
Explain how to sign up for a GitHub account and
describe how to create a repository.
Signing up for a free, personal account on GitHub is quick and easy.
Start at the GitHub site, https://github.com
You’ll need to choose a username, enter your email address and select a password,
then click Sign up for GitHub.
Next, you’ll have a short test to prove that you’re a person.
Click Verify and solve the puzzle presented.
When you’re done, click join a free plan and then you’ll be taken to a screen where
you can select the type of account – most likely a free, personal account is all that
you’ll want.
Choose to set up a personal, free account, which is the default.
GitHub asks some questions about your work, programming experience and interests.
You can skip these if you want.
Finally, you’ll have to respond to an email that you receive which proves that you linked
to GitHub from an account that you access
GitHub provides you with some starting points.
You can choose to create a repository or an organization, or you can take the Introduction
to GitHub course.
Remember, a repository is a data structure for storing documents including application
source code which tracks and maintains version-control.
An organization is a collection of user accounts that owns repositories.
Organizations have one or more owners, who have administrative privileges for the organization.
Or you can skip this for now and get straight to work.
GitHub provides many resources to help you work effectively. When you have time, read
the GitHub guide.
The heart of a Git-based project is the repository.
This contains all your code and the related artifacts, including things like:
A README file to describe the purpose of the project.
A license to express the ways in which people can use your code, Etc.
You can also make your repository private (only available to people with accounts that
have permission to see it) or public (searchable and seen by everyone).
When you create your repository, you’ll notice that it has a number of tabs, and is 37 00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,069 opened to the Code tab.
Code – this is where all the source files reside.
Git was initially created as a source code repository and now all sorts of files end
up in here.
If you created a README and/or license, that’s all that’s here right now.
Issues – as you can imagine, you can track and plan with tools such as “Issues” that
lists all open items against your project base.
Pull Requests – this is part of the mechanism for collaborating with other users.
Pull requests define changes that are committed and ready for review before being merged into
the main branch.
Projects – all the tools for managing, sorting, planning, etc. your various projects.
This is the core of the collaborative power of GitHub.
Wiki, Security, and Insights – often left for more advanced users, these tools provide
a communication base to the external user community.
Settings – GitHub allows for a lot of personalization, including changing the name of your repository
and controlling access.
In this video, you learned:
How to create and verify a GitHub account.
Repositories are storage structures that can hold Code, track Issues, and enable you to
collaborate with others.
